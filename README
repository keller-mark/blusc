# blusc

Pure rust implementation of Blosc compression and decompression.


The Blosc algorithm wraps other compression methods, including zstd, snappy, and lz4.

We will use pure rust implementations of these inner compression methods:

- ruzstd crate:: https://github.com/KillingSpark/zstd-rs
- snap crate: https://github.com/BurntSushi/rust-snappy
- lz4_flex crate: https://github.com/pseitz/lz4_flex
