# blusc


This is a pure Rust implementation of [c-blosc2](https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc2) compression and decompression.


Blusc is not intended to be as performant as the reference C implementation, as the goal here is to enable easy compilation to WASM targets (so we avoid optimizations like multi-threading, hardware acceleration, etc). I have not performed any benchmarks.

## Background

The Blosc algorithm wraps other compression methods, including zstd, snappy, lz4, and zlib. We will use pure Rust implementations of these inner compression methods:

- ruzstd crate for zstd: https://github.com/KillingSpark/zstd-rs
- snap crate for snappy: https://github.com/BurntSushi/rust-snappy
- lz4_flex crate for lz4: https://github.com/pseitz/lz4_flex
- flate2 crate for zlib: https://github.com/rust-lang/flate2-rs

This crate offers pure rust implementations of the following functions and constants:

- blosc1_cbuffer_metainfo
- blosc1_cbuffer_validate
- blosc1_cbuffer_sizes
- blosc1_getitem
- blosc2_get_complib_info
- blosc2_compress
- blosc2_decompress
- BLOSC_NOSHUFFLE
- BLOSC2_MAX_OVERHEAD
- BLOSC2_CPARAMS_DEFAULTS
- BLOSC2_DPARAMS_DEFAULTS
- blosc2_create_cctx
- blosc2_compress_ctx
- blosc2_cbuffer_sizes
- blosc2_create_dctx
- blosc2_decompress_ctx



### Motivation

I tried and [failed](https://github.com/mulimoen/rust-blosc-src/compare/main...keller-mark:rust-blosc-src:keller-mark/shims) to compile existing Rust bindings to c-blosc to WASM (requiring [shims](https://github.com/mulimoen/rust-blosc-src/issues/23) for C standard library things), which motivated this pure Rust implementation.
Another aspect that complicates things is that c-blosc internally uses C libraries such as zstd, which can result in function name conflicts when used in codebases that depend on both c-blosc and zstd bindings:

```
some_crate
  - rust-bindings-to-c-blosc
    - c-blosc (C implementation)
      - zstd (C implementation)
  - rust-bindings-to-zstd
    - zstd (C implementation)
```

More broadly, it makes sense to have alternative implementations (especially in Rust) of widely-used compression algorithms.



## Development

```sh
cargo build
```

### Testing

```sh
cargo test
```



For reference during development, this repository contains the C implementations in the `c-blosc` and `c-blosc2` directories as git submodules.


## AI usage disclaimer

This README, `Cargo.toml`, the public interface/function signatures, initial unit tests, and the contents of `src/internal/constants.rs` were written by me, a human, or manually ported.
The rest of the Rust code and other unit tests were largely LLM-generated/ported (see `AGENTS.md` for more details).
